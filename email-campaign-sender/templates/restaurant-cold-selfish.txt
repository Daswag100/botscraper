SUBJECT: {{company}} - I did something for you

Hey {{company}},

I help restaurants rank higher on Google through better reviews and local SEO.

Honestly, I'm messaging you for selfish reasons - I want {{company}} as my next case study to expand my portfolio in {{city}}.

I already analyzed your Google listing and found:
- Your {{rating}}⭐ is holding you back from top spots
- 3 quick GMB fixes that boost visibility 40-60%
- What competitors are doing that you're not

I put together a 30-day plan to get you to 4.5+ stars.

Interested? Let me know.

Talk soon,
