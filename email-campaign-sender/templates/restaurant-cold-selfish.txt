SUBJECT: {{company}} - I did something for you (selfish reasons)

Hey {{firstName}},

I help restaurants rank higher on Google and get more customers through better reviews and local SEO.

Honestly, I'm messaging you for selfish reasons...

I'm looking to expand my reach among restaurant owners in {{city}} and I want to add {{company}} to my portfolio.

I'm being selfish because I want you as my next case study.

I've already analyzed your Google listing and created a ranking strategy for you that I think can help you get more customers and increase revenue.

Here's what I found for {{company}}:
- Your {{rating}}⭐ rating is holding you back from top rankings
- 3 quick GMB optimizations that'll boost visibility 40-60%
- Exact review strategy your competitors are using to outrank you
- 30-day action plan to hit 4.5+ stars

Let me know if you want to take a look!

Talk soon,
